## Reflection 

For the 1st assignment, we learn about the basic mathematical algorithmic logic and flowchart analysis from the given questions. I learned to trace a flowchart from the beginning until the end to ensure that each step is executed properly in the correct order. I also learned between different types of loops inside c++. For example, pre-test loops and post-test loops is one of the questions that contained inside this assignment. I think for basic understanding for a beginner in a programming language like me, this is very important for us students to properly do as an introduction to programming language. Therefore, for improvement, I think that besides the pseudo code, I can include brief comments to make it much more readable for the programmer to avoid any confusion.
