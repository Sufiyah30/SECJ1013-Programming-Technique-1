## Reflection

In Assignment 2, we learned to develop complex C++ code for calculating BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). In this assignment, I gained a variety of ways to apply what I learned in the classroom to different algorithm designs, such as conversion and calculation programs. Since this assignment is very specific in the production of BMR calculation, we learned about making the coding much more friendly-user toward the usage of this program. For example, the output displays errors whenever the user inserts non-logical input inside the system, like a negative number for age, weight, and more. Other than that, the usage of precise and detailed mathematical formulas have been used inside the program to calculate the most accurate result for the output of the BMR. I think this makes me much more careful and detailed in inserting the formulas in order to avoid any calculation errors. I think this assignment is important to develop more confidence in beginner individuals like me. One improvement that can be made for me is that I need to do more of these types of assignments to familiarize myself.
