# SECJ1013-Programming-Technique-1 📝 <br>
This course teach me the beginning of using C++ in the computer language. It teaches me how to use,produce and read flowchart. I learned a lot about the complex production of a system using only C++ language in my computer. This course teaches me about the difference between the usage of  for loop, while loop, do-while loop, 1d and 2d arrays, and many more.


## Reflection for each assignments 📞 <br>

### Assignment 1 
               
For the 1st assignment, we learn about the basic mathematical algorithmic logic and flowchart analysis from the given questions. I learned to trace a flowchart from the beginning until the end to ensure that each step is executed properly in the correct order. I also learned between different types of loops inside c++. For example, pre-test loops and post-test loops is one of the questions that contained inside this assignment. I think for basic understanding for a beginner in a programming language like me, this is very important for us students to properly do as an introduction to programming language. Therefore, for improvement, I think that besides the pseudo code, I can include brief comments to make it much more readable for the programmer to avoid any confusion.


### Assignment 2 : BMR Calculations

In Assignment 2, we learned to develop complex C++ code for calculating BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). In this assignment, I gained a variety of ways to apply what I learned in the classroom to different algorithm designs, such as conversion and calculation programs. Since this assignment is very specific in the production of BMR calculation, we learned about making the coding much more friendly-user toward the usage of this program. For example, the output displays errors whenever the user inserts non-logical input inside the system, like a negative number for age, weight, and more. Other than that, the usage of precise and detailed mathematical formulas have been used inside the program to calculate the most accurate result for the output of the BMR. I think this makes me much more careful and detailed in inserting the formulas in order to avoid any calculation errors. I think this assignment is important to develop more confidence in beginner individuals like me. One improvement that can be made for me is that I need to do more of these types of assignments to familiarize myself.
